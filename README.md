# Ruby Basics Lab

## Learning Goals

* Define the body of each method

## Introduction

For this lab, you're going to be reviewing the basics of the Ruby language. Once
you fork and clone the lab down onto your computer, run the test suite with the
`learn` or `rspec` command. Read the test output in your terminal to get your
tests to pass.

## Define the Body of Each Method

We've already defined the methods for you––you need to write the code inside of
them to give them the desired behavior, as defined by the tests. Refer back to
the earlier lessons on reading test output for help.

* `#division`: It returns quotient of the first number divided by the second
  number
* `#assign_variable`: It takes an argument of a persons name and assign it to a
  variable name
* `#argue`: It accepts an argument and returns that argument unchanged
* `#greeting`: It takes two required arguments, a `name` and a `greeting`
* `#return_a_value`: It returns the phrase "Nice"
* `#last_evaluated_value`: It returns the phrase "expert"
* `#pizza_party`: It accepts an optional argument for pizza that returns
  "cheese" by default

## Conclusion

We've successfully combined methods, arguments, text output, and return values!
Now we're going to talk about scope, and how it impacts these concepts in Ruby.
