# Ruby Basics Lab

## Learning Goals

* Define a method 
* Define a method with a default argument
* Assign a variable
* Declare a return value

## Introduction

This is a test-driven lab. To get started, (once you fork and clone the lab down onto your computer), run the test suite with the `learn` or `rspec` command. Read the test output in your terminal to learn how to fill out the methods to get your tests to pass. We've already defined the methods for you––you need to write the code inside of them to give them the desired behavior, as defined by the tests. Refer back to the earlier lessons on reading test output for help. 

## SWBAT 1

* For this todo, you're going to be reviewing the basics of the Ruby language. 
* We're going to be putting a big focus on test driven development. We'll cover
  it a bunch more later, but in essence, this means that we write tests for our
  code before actually writing any code.
* With that in mind, we'll be discovering the basics of Ruby through the use of
  tests.
* You'll be running tests using the RSpec framework, watching them fail, and
  then making them pass. It's going to be a ton of fun!
* Usually you'll make the tests pass by actually writing code, but in this case
  you'll be exploring Ruby by altering the tests themselves.
* We'll run the tests, see a huge explosion of errors, go fix one of the errors,
  run the tests again, see slightly less errors and repeat.
* Open `spec/ruby_basics_spec.rb`, then come back here.
* Now, type 'rspec' to run the tests and get started! Have fun!
